# DL_Project_2023S
ECE-GY 7123: Deep Learning Project, 2023 Spring

Please go to the Jupyter Notebook to see the code and effect :)

If you want to avoid the tedious training process, you can go to https://drive.google.com/file/d/10D_qj_Jk737R0UNSYH8Y-EoHTqgi-lB1/view?usp=share_link, download the weights I have trained, and specify its path during the inference.

If you want to play with the code, you can do the following:
1. git clone https://github.com/Haoyang-Li233/DL_Project_2023S.git
2. cd /DL_Project_2023S (to your actual path)
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and see the code there. Have fun!
